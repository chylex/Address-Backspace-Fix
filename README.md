Firefox addon that tweaks Backspace in address bar to remove both the suggestion and the last typed character.

# Installation

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/chylex/Address-Backspace-Tweak/releases) and open `Address-Backspace-Tweak-<version>.xpi`. Firefox will ask you to confirm addon installation.

**This is a XUL addon which will only support up to Firefox 56.** Since Mozilla will no longer accept XUL addons in their official repository, **this addon will not be signed**, therefore you need Firefox **ESR**, **Nighly**, or **Developer Edition** with [disabled signature check](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox#w_what-are-my-options-if-i-want-to-use-an-unsigned-add-on-advanced-users) to install the addon.
