3. Firefox will ask you to confirm the installation

## Supported Browsers

**This is a XUL addon which will only be supported up to (and including) Firefox 56.**

Since Mozilla will no longer accept XUL addons in their official repository, **this addon will not be signed**, therefore you need **Firefox ESR**, **Nighly**, or **Developer Edition** with [disabled signature check](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox#w_what-are-my-options-if-i-want-to-use-an-unsigned-add-on-advanced-users) to install the addon.
